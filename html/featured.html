                <p>Marsha P. Johnson was one of the most prominent figures of the gay rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s in New York City. Always sporting a smile, Johnson was an important advocate for homeless LGBTQ+ youth, those affected by HIV and AIDS, and gay and transgender rights.</p>
                <p>Born August 24, 1945, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Johnson grew up in an African American working-class family as the fifth of seven children. She began wearing dresses at age five, but stopped after bullying and an assault. At 17, she moved to New York City with just $15 and a bag of clothes, adopting the name Marsha P. Johnson — the “P” standing for “Pay It No Mind.”</p>
                <p>Johnson faced housing instability and discrimination, working various jobs including sex work and drag performance. She became a mother figure to fellow activist Sylvia Rivera, and in 1970 they co-founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) to provide shelter and support for transgender youth.</p>
                <p>She played a role in the Stonewall Uprising, marched in early Pride events, and performed with the drag group Hot Peaches. Despite personal hardships and mental health struggles, Johnson continued her activism, speaking out for equal rights and against transphobia within the LGBTQ+ movement.</p>
                <p>In 1990, she was diagnosed with HIV and spoke openly to fight stigma. On July 6, 1992, her body was found in the Hudson River under suspicious circumstances. Her legacy endures through documentaries, public memorials, and Marsha P. Johnson State Park in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
