                <h3>Archaeologist - Specialist in Urban Artifact Stratigraphy</h3>
                <h4>Bio:</h4>
                <p>Cassia Flint holds a PhD in Archaeology from the University of Edinburgh, where her work focused on urban trans communities of the early 20th century. Known for her meticulous field notes and obsession with artifact context, she uses tools like ground-penetrating radar and 3D photogrammetry to map layers of city life previously undocumented. Cassia is currently curating the “Beneath the Ballroom” exhibit, unearthing everyday trans life in underground clubs of 1920s New York. Her background in queer archival studies helps bridge the gap between material culture and lived history.</p>

                    <p>With a background in forensic anthropology and a Master's in Indigenous Studies from UBC, Arjun Reyes focuses on reconstructing lives from skeletal and ceremonial remains. He integrates DNA analysis with ethnobotanical context to rebuild stories from fragments and uses AI bone-matching systems to link remains to long-lost diaspora communities. At the Museum of Transgender History, he catalogs remains from a matriarchal Andean society believed to have included gender-diverse leadership roles.</p>

                    <p>Eden holds an MFA in Comparative Literature and a certificate in Post-Colonial Museology from the University of Cape Town. Their work focuses on mapping trans identity through global myth systems, highlighting themes of transformation, shapeshifting, and fluidity across cultures. Eden collaborates with artists, AI poets, and animators to reframe ancient stories through a trans lens. They also question the museum as a neutral space and promote it as a site of radical healing and speculative storytelling.</p>
